    <h1><u>Straw Hat Pirates</u></h1>
    <p id="tribute-info">The Straw Hat Pirates, also known as the Mugiwara Pirates, Straw Hat Crew or simply the Straw Hats, are an infamous and powerful rising pirate crew that originated from the East Blue, but have various members from different areas. They are the main focus and protagonists of the manga and anime One Piece, and are led by the main protagonist, Monkey D. Luffy.</p><p>
      The "Straw Hats" are named after Luffy's signature hat that was given to him by Red-Haired Shanks, and are first referred to as the Straw Hat Pirates by Smoker in Arabasta. The crew sailed on the Going Merry, their first official Straw Hat ship, up until the Water 7 Arc. During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Franky and Iceburg built them a new ship which was named the Thousand Sunny by Iceburg even though the members fought over different names. The Straw Hats currently consist of ten members whose combined bounties equal Beli B3,161,000,100.
    </p><p>
      Following the events on the Sabaody Archipelago, all nine members were separated from one another. For two years, they trained in relatively isolated locations, becoming stronger for the sake of helping each other. They then reunited and have since been growing into an active and massive force in the New World, defeating the most crucial man in the Underworld and removing him from power, having an enormous and mighty pirate fleet form to serve under them and adding former Warlord of the Sea Jinbe to their crew. They have even managed to take one of Emperor Big Mom's living weapons, Zeus, into their crew, as Nami's willing servant.
